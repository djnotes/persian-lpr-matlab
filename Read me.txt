Note:(1/26/2014)
Neural.m was improved.
Problem with recognition of images was fixed. 
Accuracy of recognition was improved by modifying 
network training function parameters(e.g. net.trainParam.goal,
net.trainParam.min_grad,etc.).

LPR2.m gets a car's image and extracts digit images out 
of the plate. Note that characters are not extracted.

Neural.m reads a dataset consisting of known digit images.
It then defines a target set to help the neural network 
learn what every digit should look like. Finally a new digit
is read from disk and recognized via the trained network. 
Note that feature extraction has been used on training dataset
to reduce processing time. Also, data has been normalized 
before using in the neural network.
